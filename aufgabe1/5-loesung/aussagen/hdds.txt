Rhino pictures illegal?   Makes me sick.  I “hid” the photos…hehehehe.  Apparently, if there are less than 10 photos, it’s no big deal.  


OK.  Things are getting a little weird.  I zapped the hard drive and then threw it into the Mississippi River.
I’m gonna reformat my USB key after this entry, but try not to destroy the good stuff. Stuffed one fatty even between disks ;)
I need to change the password on the gnome account that Jeremy gave me.  I can probably just do that at Radio Shack.
